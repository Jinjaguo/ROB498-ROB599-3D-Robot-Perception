Main Course Material   
Course Description: 3D robot perception seeks to enable embodied platforms to function in the natural and everyday 3D environ ments, specifically focusing on the ability to extract useful information from sensors to support reasoning and action of those platforms. This course covers core elements of 3D scene representation (discrete, continuous, learned, etc.), inference and generation from low (eg classical multiview geometry, single view metrology) and high (eg objects, actions) levels using classical and learning-based methods.   
  
This course will be a journey through topics in 3D robot perception, touching on important fundamental methods as needed. Students and instructors alike will explore the rapidly evolving world of representing, processing, manipulating and leveraging 3D perception to support reasoning and activity in the physical world.   

Prerequisites: No prior course in computer vision is needed. EECS 281 or sufficient prior training in programming and data structures, which is necessary not only to work on real computer vision problems but also to understand how typical methods work. 
A working knowledge of calculus, linear algebra, and probability theory. Students are expected to be (or become on their own time) proficient in Python. 
The following is a list of some mathematical tools needed for this course. We will cover them as necessary, and when we do, we will cover them in as much detail as necessary to understand how to use them but not why they work. This is not a math course. These are the tools of the math of computer vision and are needed to work in computer vision. 
• Eigenvector decomposition 
• SVD 
• Linear least squares 
• Non-linear least squares 
• Robust estimation 
• Dictionary learning and sparse coding 
• Combinatorial Optimization 
• Cuts on graphs 
• Linear programming 
• Dynamic programming 
Textbooks: There is no required textbook for this course. Instructor notes will be made available as external reading and readings from the following book will be assigned periodically to deepen the understand of the material. All readings are required. 
• Szeliski Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications published by Springer and available for purchase on various website or as a download (free) at http://szeliski.org/Book/.
